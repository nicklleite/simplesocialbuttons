{"name":"Simplesocialbuttons","tagline":"A collection of custom social buttons, with Font Awesome icons.","body":"# [![Simple Social Buttons](https://nicholasleite.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/logo-bg1.png)](https://simplesocialbuttons.github.io)\r\n\r\nA collection of social buttons, that can be almost 100% customizable (the goal is reatch the 100%). All the social buttons out there are less custom and that creates a need to \"photoshop\" a new one, with your needs and words. The SSB collection solves that with text-based icons (FontAwesome) and the option to choose what text you want in the button.\r\n\r\n##FAQ\r\n**1) Wich social networks i can find in the collection?**\r\n\r\nAt the moment, we support the following social networks:\r\n\r\n    delicious\r\n    deviantart\r\n    dribbble\r\n    facebook\r\n    flickr\r\n    foursquare\r\n    github\r\n    googleplus\r\n    instagram\r\n    linkedin\r\n    pinterest\r\n    reddit\r\n    slideshare\r\n    soundcloud\r\n    stumbleupon\r\n    tumblr\r\n    twitch\r\n    twitter\r\n    vimeo\r\n    vine\r\n    vk\r\n    weibo\r\n    wordpress\r\n    youtube\r\n\r\n**2) How much is this collection can be customized?**\r\n\r\nAs much as you can. The styles that I deliver here are just a kick start for the developers who want a cool button for social sharing.\r\n\r\n-- Soon, more info :)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
