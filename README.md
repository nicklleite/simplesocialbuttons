# [![Simple Social Buttons](https://nicholasleite.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/logo-bg1.png)](http://nicklleite.github.io/simplesocialbuttons)

A collection of social buttons, that can be almost 100% customizable (the goal is reatch the 100%). All the social buttons out there are less custom and that creates a need to "photoshop" a new one, with your needs and words. The SSB collection solves that with text-based icons (FontAwesome) and the option to choose what text you want in the button.

| By default, all the buttons come in 5 different sizes, each with its,respective color and icon. (I've said that all the buttons are flat?) 	| By downloading the package, your imagination is the limit when it comes to the customization of buttons. 	| - No javascript were harmed or used during the process.  - "LESS" do it quickly 	|
