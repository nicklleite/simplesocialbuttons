# [![Simple Social Buttons](https://nicholasleite.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/logo-bg1.png)](http://nicklleite.github.io/simplesocialbuttons)

A collection of social buttons, that can be almost 100% customizable (the goal is reatch the 100%). All the social buttons out there are less custom and that creates a need to "photoshop" a new one, with your needs and words. The SSB collection solves that with text-based icons (FontAwesome) and the option to choose what text you want in the button.
